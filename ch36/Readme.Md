# üìò Django 5 ‚Äì `annotate()` Explained
## ‚úÖ What is `annotate()`?
`annotate()` is a **QuerySet method** in Django ORM used to **add calculated fields** to each item in a QuerySet using **aggregation functions** (like `Count`, `Sum`, `Avg`, etc.).

It is useful when you want to perform calculations **across relationships** (like how many books each author has).

## üîß Syntax

```python
from django.db.models import Count, Sum, Avg, Max, Min
Model.objects.annotate(new_field=AggregateFunction('related_field'))
```
````

## üìå Common Aggregation Functions

| Function  | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| `Count()` | Count related objects     |
| `Sum()`   | Sum of numeric fields     |
| `Avg()`   | Average of numeric fields |
| `Max()`   | Maximum value of field    |
| `Min()`   | Minimum value of field    |

## üß™ Basic Example

### Models

```python
# models.py
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

### Use `annotate()` to count books per author:

```python
from django.db.models import Count
authors = Author.objects.annotate(book_count=Count('book'))

for author in authors:
    print(author.name, author.book_count)
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
J.K. Rowling ‚Üí 7
George R.R. Martin ‚Üí 5
```

---

## üîÅ Multiple Annotations Example

```python
from django.db.models import Count, Avg

Author.objects.annotate(
    book_count=Count('book'),
    avg_price=Avg('book__price')
)
```

Each `Author` object will now include:

- `book_count`: number of books
- `avg_price`: average price of their books

---

## üîç Filter + Annotate

```python
Author.objects.filter(book__price__gt=300).annotate(total_books=Count('book'))
```

‚û°Ô∏è Returns authors who have books priced above 300, with the total book count.

---

## üìå Key Points

- Returns a **new QuerySet** with additional fields.
- Doesn‚Äôt modify the database.
- Can be combined with `values()`, `filter()`, `order_by()` for reporting.
- Can use `F()` expressions for advanced annotations.
